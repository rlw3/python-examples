Python is a high level interpreted coding language thats good for beginners because many functions and shortcuts are pre-written,
so you can write complex code with less words. 
Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line, top to bottom, which makes debugging easier.

Installing Python: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website.
During installation, ensure that the 'Add Python to PATH' option is checked.
                                                                                                                                
Using a code editor is really good for organizing code, running and debugging, and adding helpful extensions
                                                                                                                                
Visual Studio Code (VScode) is the one I use and its widely accepted and documented and works easily with Raspberry Pi's.
